    "\n",
    "RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation. A RAG pattern is essentially a way to augment our models response by grounding it in some sort of information retrieved from a database (typically a chunk of a document). \n",
    "\n",
    "A general flow for the RAG pattern is; \n",
    "1. A user enters a question or a prompt \n",
    "2. The users query is searched for in a vector database \n",
    "3. The documents retrieved from the vector database are passed to GenAI alongside a prompt\n",
    "    i. (for example, \"Your job is to summarize the chunks of the documents\")\n",
    "4. Our generative AI provides us a response grounded in the document. "

      "The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, it is made up of different wavelengths, including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Shorter-wavelength light, such as blue and violet, is scattered in all directions more than longer-wavelength light. As a result, the scattered blue and violet light reach our eyes from all directions, making the sky appear blue. This scattering also causes the sun to appear yellow during sunrise and sunset, as the shorter-wavelength light is scattered away from our line of sight, leaving the longer-wavelength light, like red and orange, to dominate.\n"
